Hello! I am an undergraduate student from the Biomedical Engineering Department at Southern University of Science and Technology, currently studying and researching in the Neural Computation and Control Laboratory (**NCC** Lab). 

My research focuses on EEG emotion decoding, specifically exploring robust EEG emotional representations **across different contexts**. I am also interested in **real-time**, **multimodal** EEG tasks.

In my free time, I enjoy reading science fiction literature, particularly the works of _Philip K. Dick_, _Liu Cixin_, and _Liu Yukun_, with _Greg Egan_â€™s novels being my recent reads. 

The abstract functions of the brain, such as emotion and cognition, fascinate me deeply. I welcome like-minded individuals to connect and discuss our shared interests!
